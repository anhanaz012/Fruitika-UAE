    step1:
      "Sauté two diced onions in olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat until they become translucent. This should take about 5-7 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent the onions from browning.",
    step2:
      "Add two cups of rice to the skillet and continue sautéing for an additional 3-4 minutes. Pour in four cups of chicken broth, one teaspoon of cinnamon, half a teaspoon of allspice, and a pinch of ground cloves. Let the mixture simmer until the rice is partially cooked, about 10 minutes.",
    step3:
      "Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Clean and dry the whole chicken, both inside and out. Season the chicken cavity with salt and pepper. Stuff the partially cooked rice mixture into the chicken cavity, pressing it in firmly.",
    step4:
      "Truss the chicken by tying the legs together with kitchen twine. This helps to keep the stuffing inside while roasting. Rub the outside of the chicken with olive oil, salt, pepper, and your favorite spices.",
    step5:
      "Place the stuffed chicken in a roasting pan and cover it loosely with aluminum foil. Roast the chicken in the preheated oven for about 1.5 to 2 hours, removing the foil for the last 30 minutes to allow the skin to become golden and crispy.",
    step6:
      "Check the internal temperature of the chicken, which should reach 165°F (74°C) at the thickest part of the thigh. Let the chicken rest for 10 minutes before carving. Serve hot, garnished with fresh herbs like parsley or cilantro.",

    step4:
